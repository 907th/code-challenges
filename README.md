## About This Repository

There are my own solutions for
code challenges (LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeForces, Timus, etc.) and
educational projects (Coursera, Udemy, Stepik, etc.) in this repository.

Navigation:

* ðŸ—‚ Each platform/project has its own dedicated folder at the repository root.
  Solutions for problems and assignments lives there.
* ðŸ›  There is a [Library](Library) folder.
  It contains implementations of common algorithms and data structures (for different languages).
  They help to solve code challenges faster sometimes.
* ðŸ“œ In the [Wiki](https://github.com/907th/code-challenges/wiki) I put notes, hints, code snippets, ideas, etc.
